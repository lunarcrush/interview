# Hello, would you like to work with us at LunarCrush?

We are always looking for experienced developers who can help us with our mission to be the fastest app in crypto.

## What can I do with this repo?

Feel free to make a pull request with your optimizations on any of our "bad components" to demonstrate your knowledge of React/React native.

We will also welcome your pull request with a poorly designed component that is ready to be optimized to add to our list.

## Get started

- clone this repo
- `npm install`
- `npx expo start`

  _for web_

- `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider expo start --web`
- fix one of the `BadComponent*.js` files
- pull request!

### TODO

- add more non-optimized component examples
- add backend code samples to work with
